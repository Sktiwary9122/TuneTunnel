# React Project

This is a React project created using Vite.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14.18.0 or higher recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/decoded-satapathy/TuneTunnel.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd TuneTunnel
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash

   ```

   By default, this will run the project on \`http://localhost:3000\`. If port 3000 is busy, Vite will automatically use the next available port.
